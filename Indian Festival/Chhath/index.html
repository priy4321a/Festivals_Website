        <h2>About Chhath Puja</h2>
        <p>Chhath Puja is an ancient Hindu festival dedicated to the Sun God, Surya, and Chhathi Maiya. It is mainly celebrated in Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Nepal. Devotees offer prayers and fasting to seek blessings for their well-being and prosperity. The festival includes bathing in holy rivers, fasting, and offering "Arghya" (water and milk offerings) to the Sun at sunrise and sunset.</p>
